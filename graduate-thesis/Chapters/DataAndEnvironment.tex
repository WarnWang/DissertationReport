\chapter{Simulation data and Test Environment}
\label{ch:dataAndEnv}

This chapter introduces the input data and test environments.

\section{Raw data for training}
Details of selected data is introduced in Chapter~\ref{ch:market}, the date range is varied in different test, but is behind year 2009 as some data prior to the start date is hard to be collected. \\

The input data types are introduced in Chapter~\ref{ch:market}.\\

The stocks chosen in this experiment are just the first 10 in HKEx (0001.HK to 0010.HK). \\

Three of the above companies are top 50 in market capitalization (0001.HK, 0004.HK and 0002.HK). Two of them are top 20 active stocks in dollars (0001.HK and 0005.HK). One in finance (0005.HK), 3 in Utilities (0002.HK, 0003.HK and 0006.HK), two properties (0001.HK and 0004.HK).\\

To further prove my conclusion, more stock (Symbols are 0066.HK, 6823.HK, 0014.HK, 0016.HK, 0012.HK, 0038.HK, 0032.HK, 0023.HK, 0030.HK, 0027.HK, 2282.HK, 0120.HK) are tested. All information of those stocks can be found in Appendix~\ref{append:stock_info}.\\


\section{Testing Environment}
\label{sec:environment}
The model of physical computer is Dell Inspiron Ins14VD-4516, details about the hardware information is showed in table~\ref{tb:hardwareConf}, software are listed in table~\ref{tb:softwareList}

The cluster is formed by three virtual machines (as figure~\ref{fg:clustur}). "Master" is NameNode for HDFS, and Master, HistoryServer for Spark. The other two virtual machines work as DataNode (for HDFS) and worker (for Spark). Every computer has 40GB hard disk, 2GB memory and 1 virtual CPU core.
