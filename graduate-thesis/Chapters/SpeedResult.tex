\section{Testing Environment}
The testing environment in this chapter is a little different form that is listed in Section~\ref{sec:environment} as . \\


\section{Testing Method}
Every method are trained 10 times. Target stock is 0001.HK. This testing uses two years historical data to predict 1 year data, whose whole period is from 2011-01-6 to 2014-01-06. 

\section{Testing Result}
The final result is the average performance of these method is showed in figure~\ref{fg:running_time}.
