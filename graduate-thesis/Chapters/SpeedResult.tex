The testing environment are list in Section~\ref{sec:environment}, every method are trained 10 times. Target stock is 0001.HK. Using two years historical data to predict 1 year data. The final result is the average performance of these method is showed in table~\ref{tb:running_time}.

\begin{table}[h]

		\textbf{Linear Regression} & 53.1                       & 62.3                      & 85.23\%           \\ \hline
		\textbf{Random Forest}     & 279.9                      & 385.9                     & 72.53\%           \\ \hline

As the simplest method, Linear Regression is obviously the fastest method.\\


On the other hands ANN shows great potential in distributed computing. The calculation of ANN in the process of feed forward and back propagation involves a number of matrix operations, which makes ANN the best algorithm for parallelized computing.
