\chapter{Review}
\label{ch:review}

This chapter can be splitted into two parts, section~\ref{sec:dm_dc} summarizes previous work in data mining techniques and distributed computing; section~\ref{sec:mark_prediction} describes former studies on stock market.

\section{Review of Data Mining Techniques and Distributed Computing}
\label{sec:dm_dc}
Data mining method is ``a well established field of computer science concerned with the automated search of large volumes of data for patterns that can be considered knowledge about the data'' \cite{dubitzky2008data}. It can also be described as obtaining knowledge from a large scale of data.From the date of birth, data mining technology has been widely used in various science or engineering fields such as weather forecasting, financial market analysis, astronomy, physics, and earth science, and so on. The complexity of algorithm and amount of data have higher and higher requirements on computational capability. For instance, in CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research), 30 petabytes or so of particles collision data are produced annually and researchers have to sift through all those data to find new fundamental particles.\cite{O'Luanaigh:1997391}\\ 


With increasing computing needs of data mining applications, expensive and hard-to-scale supercomputers have gradually been replaced by distributed computing, which give birth to distributed data mining. The two most popular open source frameworks for large scale data mining are: MapReduce and Spark. MapReduce was introduced as a programming model by Google to support distributed computing on large data sets on clusters, the most widely-used implementation is Hadoop MapReduce, part of Apache Hadoop project\cite[Chapter~3]{sammer2012hadoop}. Spark was frist developed by the UC Berkeley AMPLab and open-sourced in 2010, and is designed for efficient iterative applications\cite{meng2016mllib}.\\

In this study, distributed data mining is used to derive a stock prediction model from historical data and apply that model to predict future market behaviors. The distributed system are mainly based on Apache Spark. The reason why this study choose Spark instead of MapReduce is in Chapter~\ref{ch:spark}.\\
 

\section{Review of stock market understanding}
\label{sec:mark_prediction}
From the very beginning of the Stock market birth, the greedy nature encourages human beings to explore how to predict its behaviors. Many theory has been developed over that.\\


There are two opposite views on the argument that is stock market really predictable, “Random Walk” against “Efficient Market” hypothesis (EMH)\cite[Section~3.2, p.~24]{1_shadbolttaylor_2002}. Those who hold the former view believe that there are too many factors that affects stock market, which makes stock act stochastically, i.e. prediction on stock price is all but impossible. The latter theory believers think that rational investors know intrinsic values and conduct arbitrage whenever necessary, as a result, “asset prices should quickly reflect all relevant market fundamentals”\cite[Chapter~1, p.~7]{1_wong_1997}.\\


The random walk hypothesis has three main different variances depending on the strength of the assumptions\cite[Section~3.2, p.~24--25]{1_shadbolttaylor_2002}. Many tests have been developed to test this hypothesis, such as autocorrelation, Q-Statistic and variance ratio test\cite[Section~3.4, p.~28--31]{1_shadbolttaylor_2002}. Neither of these tests stand the random walk model of asset returns.\\


EMH also can be divided into three forms\cite[Chapter~1, p.~7]{1_wong_1997}, weak, semi-strong and strong form. Each have different assumptions and as a result, no investors can make excess profit from historical asset price or any other kind of information. Some evidences and empirical test supports that the U.S stock market is efficient in both the weak and semi-strong from\cite[Chapter~1, p.~7--8]{1_wong_1997}. The stock market in Hong Kong is also efficient\cite{su2015efficiency}\\


Current researches and tests on stock market strongly against the random walk hypothesis, while support EMH. It is true that “ideal” efficient is non-exist, e.g. there are always noise traders\cite{de1990noise}, who adds some kind of unpredictability to market, which make it very hard to find a perfect model that can precisely predict price changes.

\section{Review of Traditional Stock Prediction Method}

Two ways have been tried to do the predict job, one is fundamental analysis, the other is technical approaches\cite{1_edwardsmagee_1997}. “Fundamental analysts believe that an investment instrument has its intrinsic value that can be derived from the behavior and performance of its company”, while “technical analysts, on the other hand, believe that the trends and patterns of an investment instrument’s price, volume, breadth, and trading activities reflect most of the relevant market information a decision maker can utilize to determine its value.”\cite{lam2004neural}, In brief, a fundamentalist utilizes business’s financial reports to predict stock behaviors, while technician just analyze historical stock trading information.\\
