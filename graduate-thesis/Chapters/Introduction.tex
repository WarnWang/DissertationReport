\section{Problem Statement}

It is human beings' common goal to make life easier and more comfortable. Wealth can bring help to achieve this goal, and investment on stock can help people to gain wealth quickly. As a result, many research works have been done on market analysis.\par 

However, as a very complex (non-linear) and volatile system with many factors (such as companies' performance, domestic economies, festivals, seasons, etc.)\cite{chen1986economic}, stock market is difficult to be precisely predicted. Which makes investors and researchers headache, those factors usually have relationship with each other, and they will keep changing all the time. Hence, investors and fund manager must maintain real-time monitoring of market behavior and take right factors into consideration, so as to make the right trading decision.\par

Is stock price movement really predictable? How to measure the predict performance of given method? As those indicators of market keep changing every time, how can we keep tracking of them timely for many stocks? As calculating so many parameters is really demanding, but those high performance server is very expensive, can we utilize distributed computing to calculate those? With the development of machine learning, computer now can learn some human knowledge (like Alpha Go versus Lee Sedol), can them learn to predict stock price?

\subsection{Objectives}

This study is to answer the above problems. A distributed stock prediction system which consists of data tracking, model training and price prediction will be built. The 

\section{Background}

Recently, with the development of machine learning and cloud computing technologies, people find a new way to analyze many factors of stock price at a time without too much manual cost. There are many works towards prediction have been attempted, includes neural network\cite{kimoto1990stock,naeini2010stock}, multi-class support vector machine\cite{kercheval2015modelling}, linear and polynomial regression\cite{nunnostock,alexanderstock}, random forest\cite{alexanderstock,lauretto2013evaluation}. However, none of those models have become widely accepted.
