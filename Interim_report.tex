	It is human beings' common goal to make life easier and more comfortable. Wealth can bring help to achieve this goal. That's why there are so many works done to predict the stock price. As being a complex (non-linear) and volatile system with many factors (such as companies' performance, domestic economies, festivals, seasons, etc.)\cite{chen1986economic}, stock market is difficult to predicted daily behaviors, so as to the day-to-day stock price changes. Besides, those factors usually have relationship with each other (e.g. ) With the development of machine learning, people have found a new way to analyze stock price changes. \\
	There are many works towards prediction have been attempted, includes neural network\cite{kimoto1990stock,naeini2010stock}, multi-class support vector machine\cite{kercheval2015modelling}, linear and polynomial regression\cite{nunnostock,alexanderstock}, random forest\cite{alexanderstock,lauretto2013evaluation}
